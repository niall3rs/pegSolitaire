This project was to model and solve the classic puzzle of Peg Solitaire using Constraint Programming. This is a challenging problem to model with a large search space. There has been previous work on this subject, but this project goes beyond that work in supporting a generalised board and attempting to solve the more difficult European variant of the problem. The strength of the project is in the quality of the models produced, which demonstrate a considerable degree of understanding of both the problem and constraint modelling. The first example of this is in recognising that the puzzle can be solved either forwards or backwards. An empirical analysis is used to explore which direction might be solved most efficiently, and the analysis of the results is insightful. Furthermore, the treatment of both conditional symmetry of the board and of independent moves is novel and improves on the existing work in the literature - with some work it is probably publishable. The weakness of the project is in some of the writing in the dissertation. The early chapters are particularly brief (e.g. the literature review is a single page) and would have benefited from more detail and examples.
